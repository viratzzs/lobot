4. **Task Orchestration** (`src/tasks.py`)
   - Dynamic workflow creation
   - Task dependency management
   - Multi-domain query handling
   - Context-aware task routing

5. **Main System** (`main.py`)
   - Interactive command-line interface
   - Document management capabilities
   - Query processing pipeline
   - System status monitoring

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.template .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 2. Test the System
```bash
# Run the demo to verify everything works
uv run python demo.py

# Or run the full system test
uv run python test_system.py
```

### 3. Start the System
```bash
# Launch the interactive system
uv run python main.py
```

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Query
```
Enter your regulatory query: What are the reporting requirements for FDI under FEMA?
```

### Document Analysis
```
Options > 2. Analyze a document
Enter document content: [paste your contract/agreement text]
Enter regulation type: companies
```

### Adding Documents
```
Options > 3. Add documents to database
Enter file paths: rbi_circular.pdf, companies_act.txt
Enter regulation types: rbi, companies
```

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✅ No Hallucination Policy
- All responses are grounded in actual documents
- Mandatory citations for every recommendation
- Clear indication when information is not available

### ✅ Multi-Domain Expertise
- Specialized agents for different regulatory areas
- Intelligent query routing
- Cross-domain analysis capabilities

### ✅ Document Compliance Analysis
- Clause-by-clause review
- Regulatory violation identification
- Amendment recommendations with citations

### ✅ Structured Citations
- Filename, page number, section references
- Source validation and completeness scoring
- Consistent citation formatting

## 🚨 Important Notes

### First-Time Setup
1. **Add your OpenAI API key** to the `.env` file
2. **Test with the demo script** before using the full system
3. **Add regulatory documents** to the database for meaningful results

### Database Population
- The system starts with an empty database
- Use option 3 in the main menu to add documents
- Support for PDF and text files
- Automatic document chunking and indexing

### Performance Considerations
- Initial setup creates ChromaDB collections
- First query may take longer due to initialization
- Vector embeddings are cached for better performance

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `uv sync`
2. **API Key Issues**: Verify your OpenAI API key is set in `.env`
3. **Empty Results**: Add documents to the database first
4. **Slow Performance**: First query initializes the system

### Getting Help
- Check the system logs for detailed error messages
- Use the demo script to test individual components
- Review the README.md for comprehensive documentation

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Test the demo**: `uv run python demo.py`
2. **Add documents**: Use the data sources from `data.txt`
3. **Run queries**: Start with simple regulatory questions
4. **Analyze documents**: Test compliance analysis features
5. **Monitor performance**: Check system status regularly
